## Introduction

[**Olympic Games** is the greatest world athletic event for sure. This summer, Olympics will take place in Paris, France. The "City of Light" is being prepared disciplined to organize this event and thousand of athletes are working hard in order to do their best performance in the hope of winning an Olympic Medal.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

![](images/a.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 1em auto" width="474"}

[In this context, the purpose of this analysis is to focus on the special insights of previous Olympic Games from the first Olympics of the new era (Athens, 1896) to the latest (Tokyo, 2020). The data, that used to the analysis, consisted of 5 separate datasets, which taken from Kaggle. The data's link is given below:]{style="font-size: larger;"}

<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/olympic-games-medals-19862018>

## Importing libraries and datasets

[First of all, let's import the libraries that we are going to use.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(plotly)
library(patchwork)
library(countrycode)
library(leaflet)
library(maps)
library(mapdata)
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(DescTools)
library(corrplot)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
```

[Secondly, let's import our datasets.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r}
hosts<- read.csv('olympic_hosts.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ';')
countries_data<- read.csv('dictionary.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',')
athletes<- read.csv('olympic_athletes.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ';')
medals<- read.csv('olympic_medals.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ';')
results<- read.csv('olympic_results.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ';')
medals_continents <- read.csv('medals_with_continent.csv', header = TRUE, sep=';')
```

## Olympic Hosts

[The above datasets contain data about both Summer and Winter Olympic Games. However, we want to focus only on the Summer Olympics. So, with the code below, we keep in our data only these that are relative to Summer Olympics.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r}
hosts_summer <- hosts %>%
  filter(hosts$game_season == 'Summer')

kable(head(hosts_summer), format = "pipe", align = "c")
```

[In order to enrich the geography in our data, we will add continent information.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r}
hosts_summer$continent <- countrycode(hosts_summer$game_location, 'country.name', 'continent')
```

[So, from the interactive map below, you are able to see all the Summer Olympic Hosts from 1896 to 2020.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Interactive Map of Hosts

world <- ne_countries(returnclass = "sf")

merged_hosts_summer_countries <- merge(world, hosts_summer, by.x = "name", by.y = "game_location")

base_map_hosters <- leaflet(data = merged_hosts_summer_countries) %>%
  addTiles()

merged_hosts_summer_countries <- merged_hosts_summer_countries %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(popup_info = paste(game_name, collapse = "<br/>")) %>%
  ungroup()

map_olympic_hosters <- leaflet(data = merged_hosts_summer_countries) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(fillOpacity = 0.2, color = "dodgerblue2", weight = 1) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~label_x, lat = ~label_y, radius = ~4,opacity = 2, 
                   popup = ~popup_info,
                   color = 'red') %>%
  addControl(html = 'Hosts of Summer Olympic Games from 1896 to 2020', position = 'bottomleft')

map_olympic_hosters

```

[To sum up this information, the bar chart below shows that the majority of hosts are from Europe and the minority are from Oceania.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r,  fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
continents_colours <- c("green", "yellow","blue","red")

continents_hoster_over_the_years <- ggplot(hosts_summer, aes(x=continent, fill=continent))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'count', show.legend = FALSE)+
  theme_hc() +
  ggtitle("Summer Olympic Games Hosts by Continent") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 13),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "darkgreen", size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic"),
    axis.title = element_text(size=15)
  )+
  scale_fill_manual(values=continents_colours)+
  geom_text(
    aes(label = stat(count)),
    stat = 'count',
    colour='black',
    vjust = 0.2,
    size = 6,
    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)
  )+
  xlab("Continent")+
  ylab("")

continents_hoster_over_the_years
```

[Nevertheless, the countries that have hosted more than 2 Olympics during history, are noticed below.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r, out.width='100%'}
top_hosts <- hosts_summer %>%
  group_by(game_location) %>%
  filter(n()>2)

kable(table(top_hosts$game_location), format = "pipe", align = "c", col.names = c('Country', 'Hosting Frequency'), )
```

[Just to notify, France is going to be added to this closed list of top Olympic hosts, because is already have hosted 2 Olympic Games (Paris, 1900, Paris 1924)]{style="font-size: larger;"}

## Counting Olympic Medals

[Now, let's have a look on medals' situation. Before making the charts, it is necessary to prepare our data.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r}
names(medals)[2] <- "game_slug"

medals_from_summer_olympic_games <- inner_join(hosts_summer, medals, by= 'game_slug')

countries_medals <- data.frame(table(medals_from_summer_olympic_games$country_name, medals_from_summer_olympic_games$medal_type, medals_from_summer_olympic_games$event_gender, medals_from_summer_olympic_games$participant_type))

names(countries_medals)[1] <- "Country"
names(countries_medals)[2] <- "Medal_Type"
names(countries_medals)[3] <- "Gender"
names(countries_medals)[4] <- "Team_Individual_Sport"
names(countries_medals)[5] <- "Total_Number"
```

[Firstly, the bar chart below, indicates the countries with the most Olympic medals in history.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r,  fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
aggr_total_medals_number<- aggregate(Total_Number~Country, countries_medals, sum)  

countries_with_the_most_medals <- aggr_total_medals_number %>%
  group_by(Total_Number) %>%
  filter(Total_Number > 500) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_Number))

countries_colour_2 <- c('green4','darkred','gray31','firebrick','darkgreen','green','grey','red','gold2','blue','blue4')

countries_with_the_most_medals_plot <- ggplot(countries_with_the_most_medals, aes(y=reorder(Total_Number, -Country), x=Total_Number, fill=Country))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  theme_hc() +
  ggtitle("Countries with the most medals from 1896 to 2020 ") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 13),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "darkgreen", size = 11),
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic"),
    axis.title = element_text(size=15),
    axis.text.y = element_blank()
  )+
  ylab("")+
  xlab("Total Number of Olympic Medals")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=countries_colour_2)+
  geom_text(
    aes(label=Total_Number),
    stat = 'identity',
    colour='ghostwhite',
    fontface='bold',
    vjust = 0.2,
    size = 5,
    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)
  )
countries_with_the_most_medals_plot
```

[On the other side, there are 20 countries have won only 1 medal in this event!!!]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r}
countries_with_only_1_medal <- aggr_total_medals_number %>%
  group_by(Total_Number) %>%
  filter(Total_Number==1)

kable(countries_with_only_1_medal$Country, format = "pipe", align = "c", col.names = "Countries with only 1 Olympic Medal in History") 
```

## Olympic Medals in Association with Gender and Sports Type

[A quite interesting insight is the association between total numbers of medals and gender and between total number of medals and sports type. Notice that the following charts are based only on countries with the most medals.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', out.height='80%', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

countries_with_the_most_medals_with_gender <- inner_join(countries_with_the_most_medals, countries_medals, by = 'Country')%>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  filter(Gender=='Men' | Gender=='Women')

gender_colours <- c("orange3", "blueviolet")

medals_by_gender_totals <- countries_with_the_most_medals_with_gender %>%
  group_by(Country, Gender) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(Total_Number.y))


plot_medals_by_gender <- ggplot(medals_by_gender_totals, aes(y=Country, x=total, fill=Gender))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  theme_hc() +
  ggtitle("Countries with the most medals by Gender from 1896 to 2020 ") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "darkgreen", size = 8),
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic"),
    axis.title = element_text(size=9)
    #axis.text.y = element_blank()
  )+
  ylab("Countries")+
  xlab("Total Number of Medals")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=gender_colours)+
  geom_text(data = medals_by_gender_totals, aes(label = total), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = "black", size = 3)+
  theme(
          legend.text = element_text(size = 8), 
          legend.title = element_text(size = 8)
        )

sport_type_colour<- c("orange3", "blueviolet")

medals_by_sport_type_totals <- countries_with_the_most_medals_with_gender %>%
  group_by(Country, Team_Individual_Sport) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(Total_Number.y))

plot_medals_by_sports_type <- ggplot(medals_by_sport_type_totals, aes(y=Country, x= total, fill=Team_Individual_Sport))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  theme_hc() +
  ggtitle("Countries with the most medals by Sport's Type from 1896 to 2020 ") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(color = "darkgreen", size = 8),
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic"),
    axis.title = element_text(size=9)
    #axis.text.y = element_blank()
  )+
  ylab("Countries")+
  xlab("Total Number of Medals")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = sport_type_colour)+
  geom_text(data = medals_by_sport_type_totals, aes(label = total), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = "black", size = 3)+
  theme(
          legend.text = element_text(size = 8), 
          legend.title = element_text(size = 8)
        )

plot_medals_by_gender  / plot_medals_by_sports_type

```

[Now we are going to examine the existence of association between gender and medal type. To achieve this, firstly we will make a scatter plot for each medal type.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gold_medals_by_gender <- countries_medals %>%
  group_by(Medal_Type) %>%
  filter(Medal_Type=='GOLD') %>%
  group_by(Total_Number) %>%
  filter(Total_Number >0) %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  filter(Gender=='Men' | Gender=='Women')

silver_medals_by_gender <- countries_medals %>%
  group_by(Medal_Type) %>%
  filter(Medal_Type=='SILVER') %>%
  group_by(Total_Number) %>%
  filter(Total_Number >0) %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  filter(Gender=='Men' | Gender=='Women')

bronze_medals_by_gender <- countries_medals %>%
  group_by(Medal_Type) %>%
  filter(Medal_Type=='BRONZE') %>%
  group_by(Total_Number) %>%
  filter(Total_Number >0) %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  filter(Gender=='Men' | Gender=='Women') 

plot_gold_by_gender <- ggplot(gold_medals_by_gender, aes(x=Gender, y=Total_Number, colour=Gender))+
        geom_jitter(size=2, show.legend=FALSE)+
        theme_hc() +
        ggtitle("Won Gold Medals by Gender ") +
        theme(

          axis.text = element_text(color = "darkgreen", size = 8),
          axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic"),
          axis.title = element_text(size=10)
        )+
        scale_colour_manual(values=gender_colours)
       

plot_silver_by_gender <- ggplot(silver_medals_by_gender, aes(x=Gender, y=Total_Number, colour=Gender))+
        geom_jitter(size=2)+
        theme_hc() +
        ggtitle("Won Silver Medals by Gender ") +
        theme(
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),
          panel.grid = element_blank(),
          axis.text = element_text(color = "darkgreen", size = 8),
          axis.text.x = element_text(face = "italic"),
          axis.title = element_text(size=10)
        )+
        scale_colour_manual(values=gender_colours)+
   theme(
          legend.text = element_text(size = 8), 
          legend.title = element_text(size = 8)
        )

plot_bronze_by_gender <- ggplot(bronze_medals_by_gender, aes(x=Gender, y=Total_Number, colour=Gender))+
        geom_jitter(size=2, show.legend=FALSE)+
        theme_hc() +
        ggtitle("Won Bronze Medals by Gender") +
        theme(
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10),

        )+
        scale_colour_manual(values=gender_colours)

plot_gold_by_gender + plot_silver_by_gender + plot_bronze_by_gender
```

[It seems that maybe there is a difference between male and female winning of all types of medals. So, a statistical test and specially t-test, is reasonable to carry out.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r}
t_test_gold <- tidy(t.test(Total_Number~Gender, data = gold_medals_by_gender))
t_test_silver <- tidy(t.test(Total_Number~Gender, data = silver_medals_by_gender))
t_test_bronze <- tidy(t.test(Total_Number~Gender, data = bronze_medals_by_gender))

t.test_names <- c("diff", "Men","Women","statistic", "p-value", "parameter", "conf.low", "cong.high", "method", "alternative")

kable(t_test_gold, format = "markdown", align = "c", col.names = t.test_names, caption = "t-test between male and female on winning gold medal" )
kable(t_test_silver, format = "pipe", align = "c", col.names = t.test_names, caption = "t-test between male and female on winning silver medal")
kable(t_test_bronze, format = "pipe", align = "c", col.names = t.test_names, caption = "t-test between male and female on winning bronze medal")
```

[From the results above, there is a significant difference between male and female on winning gold, silver, and bronze medals (p\<0.05). The mean value is higher in males at all the medal types.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

## Athletes winning medals in their country

[In order to examine the situation that host country and athletes from it have more possibilities to win a medal, i.e Olympic Champions, we will carry out a correlation test. To specify, the test that we are going to run is the Fisher's Exact Test.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r}
fisher_test_country_medal<- tidy(fisher.test(x= medals_from_summer_olympic_games$game_location,
            y=medals_from_summer_olympic_games$country_name, simulate.p.value = TRUE))

kable(fisher_test_country_medal, format = "pipe", aligh="c")
```

[It seems that there is statistically significant relation between country that host Olympics and the Olympic Champions (p\<0.05). In other words, an athlete has more possibilities to win a medal if his country will host the Olympic Games.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r}
contigency_table <- table(x= medals_from_summer_olympic_games$game_location,
                          y=medals_from_summer_olympic_games$country_name)
kable(Assocs(contigency_table), format = "pipe", align = "c")

```

[The Contingency Coefficient of this relation, is equal to 0.6846. In the following table, it is presented the Contingency Table of France, as an example.]{style="font-size: larger;"}

```{r}
contigency_table <- as.data.frame(contigency_table)

contigency_table_france <- contigency_table %>%
  group_by(y) %>%
  filter(y == 'France') %>%
  group_by(Freq) %>%
  filter(Freq != 0)

kable(contigency_table_france, format = "pipe", align = "c", col.names = c("Host Country", "Athlete's Country", "Number of Medals"))

```

[So, is France in the position to win more medals than the previous Olympics (Tokyo, 2020) , at least? Notice, that in France have been conquered totally 146 medals by French. In addition, French Olympians have won 152 medals in American land, a little bit more the in French Land. The reason of that confusion is very simple. As we saw in a previous table USA has organized 4 times the Olympic Games in the past, 2 more that France. And still the difference is only 6 medals!]{style="font-size: larger;"}

[By carrying out this small analysis for Olympics, we wish you to enjoy the Games!!! For questions or proposals about this analysis and generally this topic, feel free to communicate with us.]{style="font-size: larger;"}
